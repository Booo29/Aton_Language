# Aton_Language(University Project)

This project is a small custom programming language developed using Python. It allows for basic operations such as arithmetic expressions, variable declarations, and control flow structures. The language was implemented using libraries such as SLY (Sly Lex Yacc) for lexical analysis and parsing, and PyQt5 for creating a simple graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic:** Supports operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Variables:** Allows for declaring and assigning values to variables.
- **Control Flow:** Basic support for if-else conditions and loops.
- **Error Handling:** Detects and displays syntax and semantic errors.
- **GUI:** Includes a graphical interface for writing and running code using PyQt5.

## Libraries Used

- **SLY (Sly Lex Yacc):** A Python library used for building lexers and parsers.
- **PyQt5:** A Python library for creating a GUI where users can write, edit, and execute their programs.
- **Other Libraries:** Common Python libraries such as sys, os, etc.
